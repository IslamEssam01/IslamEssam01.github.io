## Projects
### Programming Language Interpreter
- Developed an Interpreter: Implemented an interpreter for the Monkey programming language, following the structure and principles from Thorsten Ball's book "Writing An Interpreter In Go."
- Language Implementation: Designed and built a lexer and parser for the Monkey language to process and understand Monkey code.
- AST Representation: Constructed an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the structure of Monkey programs, facilitating code evaluation.
- Code Evaluation: Created an evaluator to execute the AST, supporting the execution of Monkey programs with various constructs such as variables, functions, arrays, and hashes.
- Interactive REPL: Developed an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) to allow users to write and test Monkey code dynamically.
- Object System: Implemented a system to handle Monkey objects, including built-in types like Integers, Booleans, Strings, Arrays, and Hashes.
- Project Structure: Organized the project into modular components including lexer, parser, AST, evaluator, and REPL, enhancing maintainability and readability.
 
### Drowsiness Tracking
- TCCD Research Day â€“ Cairo University
- Real-time Eye Tracking: Developed a system using Python and OpenCV and Dlib for tracking eye movements in real-time
- Head Pose Estimation: Implemented algorithms to determine head orientation, enhancing tracking accuracy.
- Drowsiness Detection: Created a feature to detect drowsiness and trigger an alarm system.
- Machine Learning Models: Utilize pre-trained models for precise analysis of eye movements.
- Module Development: Designed and tested modules for eye and gaze tracking.
